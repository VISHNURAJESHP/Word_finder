# Word_finder
This project involves creating a REST API that accepts multiple paragraphs of text as input and stores each paragraph along with word-to-paragraph mappings in a PostgreSQL database. The API also provides functionality to search for specific words and retrieve the top 10 paragraphs where the word is present.
